# 🚀 **Quantum-Powered Website** 🌐

Behold the source code for **my** **cutting-edge, quantum-resilient** website—an epic fusion of minimalist design and backend wizardry. 🌟

You can find it https://www.joaooliveira.xyz.

## **🛠️ Tech Stack**

Prepare for an exhilarating deep dive into the technology vortex:

- **HTML, CSS & JS**: Harnessing the **full potential** of **ancient yet powerful front-end sorcery**. Why reinvent the wheel when it’s already spinning at light speed? 🛞✨
- **sqlite3**: The mighty **SQLite3**, Python’s **secret weapon**, powers this site with a robust, **quantum-entangled database system**. Simple, elegant, and ready to take on anything thrown at it. 🧩⚡
- **Flask w/ Jinja Templates**: For those moments when **flexibility** meets **jinja-fueled templating alchemy**. 🧪🔧
- **gunicorn**: The production environment runs on **Gunicorn**, the **multi-headed hydra** of web servers, ensuring that requests are handled with **blazing speed** and **infinite concurrency**. 🔥🦄

That’s the tech stack—efficient, powerful, and free from unnecessary complexity. No over-engineering here! 🚫🛠️

> **No React Allowed** 🚫⚛️
>
> The codebase remains a React-free zone—because **sometimes less is more**.

## **🔮 Roadmap Brainstorm**

Welcome to the **hypothetical innovation lab**—a place where ideas **quantum leap** from concept to reality… someday:

- **Visitation Analytics**: Implement a **hyper-dimensional tracking system** to analyze who’s visiting and where they’ve been in the codebase matrix. 🌍🔍
- **Blog-Like Thing**: Develop a **dynamic thought repository**—because every site needs a **place for random musings** and **technical incantations**. 📝✨

**Stay tuned** as this project evolves at the speed of thought—or perhaps slightly slower, because **good things take time**. ⏳🌟
